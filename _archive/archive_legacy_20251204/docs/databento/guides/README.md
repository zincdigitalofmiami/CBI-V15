# Databento Guides

High‑level and step‑by‑step Databento guides live here.

Current guides:

- `DBN_WORKFLOW.md` – Future plan for using Databento Binary Encoding (DBN) as the raw “tape” format for intraday and microstructure data, and how it will feed the existing raw → staging → features → training pipeline.

For the integration index across loaders and schedulers (Python + BigQuery), see `docs/databento/README.md`.
